# HTML Redirect
This is a basic HTML redirect template that can be used with GitHub Pages. 

Some domain registrars charge a fee to redirect your website, so I created this easy template to redirect a domain by pointing it to GitHub. 

How  To Use:
1. Fork this repository
2. Edit index.html 
3. Replace url "swoicik.com" with the domain you wish to use
4. Commit your changes
5. In your repository go to Settings
6. Scroll down to GitHub Page
7. Choose main branch for your pages
8. Hit Save
9. Point the domain you wish to use to GitHub Pages by following these directions - https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site
10. Test, and You're Done!
